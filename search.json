    "text": "Perceptual proxies (empirical)\nBased on Perceptual proxies for extracting averages in data visualization\n\nIntroduction\nAcross science, education, and business, we process and communicate data visually. One bedrock finding in data visualization research is a hierarchy of precision for perceptual encodings of data, e.g., that encoding data with Cartesian positions allows more precise comparisons than encoding with sizes. But this hierarchy has only been tested for single value comparisons, under the assumption that those lessons would extrapolate to multi-value comparisons.\n\n\nData Collection or Source\nWe ran four within-subject behavioral experiments (three preregistered) to measure subjects’ ability to differentiate single values or set averages. The experiments used a staircase method to measure accuracy when comparing pairs of dot plots (position), floating bar graphs (length), or regular bar graphs (position + length).\n\n\nData Analysis\nWe used the stopping point of the staircase to estimate the just noticeable difference and ran within-subject anovas and t-test to estimate differences between (1) chart types, (2) single values vs. set averages, and (3) set sizes.\n\n\nAnalysis Results\nResults include: (1) Confirming known findings in the visualization literature, the results showed that single-value comparison was least precise with floating bar graphs (length only). (2) However, when comparing averages across multiple data points, the discriminability was indistinguishable between chart types. (3) An exploratory analysis found that comparisons between different set sizes reduced accuracy but not reliably for all chart types.\n\n\nConclusion\nViewers compare values using surprisingly primitive perceptual cues, e.g., the summed area of bars in a bar graph. These results highlight a critical need to study a broader constellation of visual cues that mediate the patterns that we can see in data, across visualization types and tasks.\n\n\nMaterials\nTBD"

Both require that the collected data and supporting materials be shared, so others can examine, reuse, and extend them. Assessing the accessibility of these components and the paper itself can serve as a proxy for the reliability, replicability, and applicability of a field’s research.\n\n\nData Collection or Source\nI checked all papers published in VIS in 2017 to see which were available on a preprint repository, included a preregistration, included data collection materials, included raw data, or included computation/analysis materials.\n\n\nData Analysis\nIn an exploratory analysis of all VIS publications in 2017, I calculated the proportion of papers with a preprint and open practices on a reliable open access repository or a website without long-term availability.\n\n\nAnalysis Results\nA minority of published articles are available on an open access server, and extremely few included additional research materials on an open and reliable repository. The availability also varied by conference track.\n\n\nConclusion\nThe lack of open practices may severely hamper the ability to scrutinize, replicate, or reproduce visualization research. The paper provides suggestions for authors, reviewers, and editors to improve the poor state of open practices in the field.\n\n\nMaterials\nTBD"

This approach draws from two ideas: multiverse analysis, a philosophy of statistical reporting where paper authors report the outcomes of many different statistical analyses in order to show how fragile or robust their findings are; and explorable explanations, narratives that can be read as normal explanations but where the reader can also become active by dynamically changing some elements of the explanation.\n\n\nImplementation\nWe use R scripts to build EMARs by pre-computing analysis results from every universe from a combination of all analysis parameters in a given multiverse. The output from those scripts is then presented using interactive HTML+JavaScript templates.\n\n\nDemonstration\nWe prototype five example EMARs by re-analyzing existing papers and building interactive papers to demonstrate different interactive approaches to communicating multiverses. We show how combining multiverse analysis and explorable explanations might complement existing reporting approaches and constitute a step towards more transparent research papers.\nBased on these examples and existing literature on multiverse analysis, we develop a design space for multiverse analysis reports. Our design space describes analysis parameters, analysis options, and multiplexing and aggregation techniques for summarizing and communicating multiverses. We identify several challenges to multiverse construction, including identifying simple end goals that can be multiplexed across universes (which can be easier with single statistics than entire plots, for example), and provide recommendations for writing conclusions in papers that span multiverses (to avoid authors/readers simply selecting desired results).\n\n\nConclusion\nThe development of tools to facilitate the multiverse analysis process within analysts’ workflows remains a substantial challenge: our prototypes consist of custom R scripts and HTML templates that require significant technical expertise to develop. Automating these workflows for data analysts is an important next step.\n\n\nMaterials\nSee live demo here.
